"""Persistence / commit layer for lending.

The pure rules live in ``app.engines.borrow_rules`` and never touch a
database. Everything here is about *where the write-back granularity is
pinned*:

* A lend is ONE ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` transaction: the eligibility read, the
  ``loans`` INSERT and the ``items.status`` UPDATE all commit together or
  roll back together. A failure halfway through can never leave an item
  ``on_loan`` without a loan row, or a loan row without ``on_loan``.
* Because the lock is taken at the start of the transaction, a second
  concurrent lend re-reads the state the winning transaction committed - it
  can never lend against a stale ``available`` status.
* Board reads run inside a single deferred read transaction, so the left
  pane (available items), the right pane (active/overdue loans) and the top
  strip all observe one consistent snapshot - never a half-committed world.

HTTP routes only call these functions; they contain no SQL themselves.
